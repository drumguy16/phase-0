*What is a wireframe?

	A wireframe is a rough visual representation for the layout of a webpage and it's elements

*What are the benefits of wireframing?

	The benefits of wireframing are that it allows designers to lay all elements out visually and make adjustments so that when they begin the coding process, They know wht elemnts to creat and how they will be marked up semantically.  It serves as a kind of blueprint to follow. 

*Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

	I did!!!... Mostly

*Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

	I ended up making small revisions

*What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

	There was a little bit of a learning curve to the App software I used for wireframing so I had to look at a couple resources to get going with that. I also looked at a couple freelance designer's sites as a reference to get inspiration for my own.

*Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

	I enjoyed the process of planning out the blueprints for my site. That was fun and creatively fulfilling. It was a bit tedious trying to figure out which wireframing app to go with and then learning that most of them actually required subscription fees after the first use.
