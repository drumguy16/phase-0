*How was your experience translating a wireframe into HTML?

	This experience seemed fairly seemless. It was much easier than the times I've tried to create web pages without a visual aid.

*What new tricks or elements did you learn about in HTML?

	I learned a bit about <article> tags and when they are appropriately used as semantic HTML. I think I used this tag properly. I also learned how to find social media widgets and embed them into my HTML. Not sure if I'm suppose to be doing that yet.

*Are you excited to start incorporating the design you chose next week?

	I'm excited and nervous about incorporating design into my work flow next week. Excited because my It will be fun to play around with styling elements. Nervous because I know CSS can be tricky.
