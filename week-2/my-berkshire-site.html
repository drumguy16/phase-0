- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  
  I have a good amount of experience with HTML and CSS so this challenge wasn't a new experience for me. Nevertheless, turning HTML into a functioning webpage is always an empowering feeling.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

  This was interesting because it seems like not every semantic tag is cut and dry. There seams to be a bit of room for interpretation. Also, sometimes it seemed difficult to implement semantic tags in this challenge not knowing exactly what the purpose of each element would be or how it would be styled.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  
  I think we did pretty well at keeping best practices. Nesting indentations and everything.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  
  HTML seems to be a pretty consistent language so far. It's also eay to quickly read and understand, therefore pretty easy to troubleshoot. I can't see much that seems bad about HTML so far. I don't think I have the context to find problems with it yet.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  
  Honestly, I can't think of any tricks that I currently use to remember HTML. I just try to rep code in my head and in Sublime as much as possible.
