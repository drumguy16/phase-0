			<h1>Version Control Systems</h1>
			<h2>The Benefits of Git and Github</h2>
			<h4>January 3, 2016</h4>
			<h3>Why Version Control?</h3>
			<p>Version control is a very important system for developers. A version control system allows many developers to work on a file or project simultaneously without the possibility of overwriting each others code. The master project is stored remotely and is always accessible to everyone on the team. Meanwhile, changes are made locally on individual copies, or branches. Each member of the team is able to work on different parts of the file and seamlessly merge changes together with the master at any time. All versions of the file are logged and notated with messages explaining what changes were incorporated. This means that any version of the project can be recalled at any point and that if something gets screwed up, the project can be reverted to a previous less screwy version.</p>
			<h3>What is Git?</h3>
			<p>Git is a system of version control that helps you keep track of changes by allowing you to work on and experiment with copies or branches of a file locally before merging new code with the remote master project. Each git branch is commited or saved with a message explaining what changes that particular branch incorporates.</p>
			<h3>What is Github?</h3>
			<p>Github, not to be confused with git, is the remote storage location for the master copy of a project and all of it's previous incarnations. Using Github or a remote storage location of the like, allows team members to have constant acces to a project's files, latest version, and any previous version so that they can pull copies of those files and work on them locally.</p>
