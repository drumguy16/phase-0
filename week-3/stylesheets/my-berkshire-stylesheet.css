/*What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
	
	make sure you have the complete relative file path laid out. Use ../ to back out of the the current directory your html lives in

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

	We used a variety of positioning methods including floats for the link columns, margin:auto; to center content in wrappers,
	clear:both; to keep elements from shifting up beside other elements, and different margins to adjust spacing 
	between elements.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

	We used colr, background-color,font-size, border, and font-weight.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

	We used both classes and ids. We only used ids for sections that would appear once on the page. For sections that we 
	stylings we knew we would use on multiple elements we used classes.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

I think there was a lot of extra html in the actual source code that could have been cleaned up by using semantic HTML 5 tags and styling more with
CSS.
