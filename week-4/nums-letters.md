*What does puts do?

	puts simply stands for put string. This command will output information to your screen followed by a new line.

*What is an integer? What is a float?

	An integer is a number with no decimal point. A float is a number with a remainder or decimal point.

*What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

	In division, integers are quotients with no remainder value. Floats will have a remainder value.

*How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

	Ruby handles these functions just like a normal calculator would.

*What is the difference between integers and floats?

	Integers are whole numbers whereas floats have decimal points or remainder values.

*What is the difference between integer and float division?

	In division, integers are quotients with no remainde rvalue. Floats will have a remainder value.

*What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

	A string is an object that holds any number of characters between single or double quotes. Strings could be used to store information that reads more closely to a human language and then set to a variable for storage.

*What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

	A local variable is any set of characters beginning with a lower case letter and assigned to a certain set of data. You can use variables to store a set of data and then call up that set of data by the variable's name.

*How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

	This challenge was a solid review of Ruby basics and it also gave me a first run-through using sublime text for ruby code and testing with rspec.
