#Pseudocode
#Input: Array of names from cohort
#output: Arrays of 4 or 5 people

#steps
#create an array with all names of cohort
#add names one at a time to new array until new array has 4 names
#print out new array
#keep repeating until cohort array is empty

#initial solution

def acct_groups(everyone)
	until everyone.empty?
  group = [] 
    until group.length == 4
      group << everyone.pop
    end
   p group
  end
end

acct_groups(cohort)

#refactored

def acct_groups(everyone)
	p everyone.each_slice(4) {|x| p x}
end

#Reflections
# What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge? The most interesting part of this challege was learnning about the each_slice enumerable method. The most difficult part was trying to break down the the logic piece by piece in to pseudocode that made sense.

# Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down? I am improving, allbeit fairly arduously.

# Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better? My approach for this challenge worked as a MVP. I did not allow myself as much time as I would have liked, but I could have made my solution better by adding names (group1, group2, etc.) to each of the accountability groups created. I could have also radomized the output in some fashion.
# What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why? I decided to store my groups in arrays because they seemed to be the most straight forward and easy to produce.
# What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods? By researching and refactoring, I learned about the Ruby enumerable method, each_slice. I found that it could help me achieve the same basic output from my initial solutuion in a more elegant fashion.
