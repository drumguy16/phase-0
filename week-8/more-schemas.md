Q:When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
A:Generally you might have a one-to-one database where one entity contains the basic data that is most often queried while the other contains more specific related data. 

Q:What is a many-to-many database?

Q:When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
A:A many-to-many database would be used when one entity's instances could belong to multiple of anothers entity's instances and the other entity's instances could have many of the first entity's instances.

Q:What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
A:Conceptually, database schemas make sense. I think I need some more real-world context for each of these different types before I really understand the practicality of when to use each.
