<h1>Think About Time</h1>

In the "Think About Time" challenge, I researched material about methods such as the pomodoro technique, focussed attention, battling the 'resistance', creating habits. I also learned about a concept that is new to me called "Time Boxing."  Time boxing is basically approaching a session or challenge for specifically designated amounts of  time and then assessing your progress at the end of that time.  I plan to employ this technique in phase 0 by working on individual challenges for 20 min. at a time (starting out) and assessing how much I was able to accomplish in each challenge. This would allow me to start gauging what I am able to accomplish in certain amounts of time so that I can more effectively manage my time in and around this course. This technique would also allow me to be more fully immersed in the challenges I am working on and tune out distractions. Currently my method of time management is taking huge chunks of time (like full days off) and dedicating them to a task or a list of tasks. This usually results in a very free-form approach whereby I end up wasting much of those huge chunks of time due to getting sidetracked by distractions.  I plan to take tiny, structured, habit-forming, steps, as the techniques in this challenge suggest, toward a more productive and and attentive work model for my curriculum in Phase 0. 

<h1>The Command Line</h1>


A shell is a type of CLi or a command line with no graphic interface. Bash is just a unix based shell or command line. I think the most challenging part of this exercise was simply getting use performing functions on the computer without the aid of a graphic interface. It was quite easy to get lost navigating from file to file and folder to folder while performing functions and not being able to rely on a visual aid. Though it was a bit tedious, I was able to successfully use all of the listed commands. I found myself occasionally consulting other resources for more context to better understand what I was doing with a few of the commands. I think the most important commands are going to be those that aid in navigation (pwd, ls, ../, cd) since you can't rely on graphic interfaces in the shell environment. 

-pwd = print working directory

-ls = list directory

-mv = move file or directory

-cd = change directory

-../ = takes you back or up one directory

touch = lets you create a new empty file

mkdir = makes a directory

less = is a pager that lets you page through a file via the spacebar

rmdir = removes a directory

help = (or in the case of the mac shell; apropros) shows suggestions for appropriate command definitions in the manual

<h1>Forking and Cloning</h1>

To create a new repository in Github, simply log on to your account and click the  + drop down menu icon in the top right of your browser. Select "New Repository" from the drop down menu. On the next page you are prompted to name the repository and set it's properties. Check to see that the ownership is set to the correct owner preceding the /"repository name." Name the repository "fork town fun time" or whatever you would like to call it. Next, choose the appropriate privacy and license settings and click "Create Repository." This will bring you to the new repository's hosting page. To fork a repo, navigate to the repo, first. Then, simply click the "fork" icon in the top right of your browser and choose your Github account name that you would like to fork it to. This action may take a second to process. grab the link next to the https: drop down menu and copy it to your clipboard. Inside your terminal navigate to the directory where you would like the forked repo to live locally and type the command: git clone "link to the repo"  

You may be prompted for your account username and PW. Bada Bing, Fun Times Forking! We do this so that we can work on/tinker with copies of projects in our local environment without affecting the remote master.  

I did not personally have any struggles setting up git or my Github account, however I had no idea what to make of them initially.  Now I am gaining context and confidence in the basic functionality of both. I know how to create clones of projects I will soon be contributing to and bring them into my local environment!!!
