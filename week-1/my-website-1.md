<h1>My Website Part 1</h1>

-Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

  [My website's github repository](https://github.com/drumguy16/drumguy16.github.io)

-Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

  To create a repository in Github: 
  -Navigate to your github account
  -Click the + dropdown menu icon in the upper right of your browser
  -Click *New Repository*
  -Choose the owner of the repository from the owner dropdown menu
  -Name the repository under repository name
  -Select the appropriate privacy settings 
  -Choose the appropriate license from the license dropdown menu. If you're not picky about who uses this file or how they use it, choose *MIT License*.
  -Highlight and copy the web address next to the *HTTPS* tab.
  -Navigate to your computer's command line.
  -If you have a specific location you would like the repository clone to live navigate to that location using the command: cd file/path/name  *Replace file/path/name with the actual file path to specific folder*
  -Type the command: git clone *paste the copied URL here* and hit enter. You may be prompted for you github account user name and password

-Describe what open source means.

  If something is Open source, it means that it is free to use and distribute by the online community.

-What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

  I like the idea of being able to pull, contribute to, and manipulate code from sources freely.  I have questions about whether or not Open Source is a sustainable model for the internet. It kind of seems like we have tons of people contributing all types of content via youtube, wikipedia, instagram, github, google, and only the people with the biggest computers are able to actually capitalize on this content.  Hopefully I will gain more insight and context for the concept of Open Source through my time at DBC :)

-Assess the importance of using licenses.

 Lincensing is important to the open source community because it allows developers to share and contribute software and code in a regulated manner.


-What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

  In this challenge, the process of going through my git practices and Github workflow became more solidified. Before this challenge I was still struggling with seeing every step in my head. I kept having to revisit previous challenges and notes to refresh my memory.

-Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  I did find a YouTube video about git that was helpful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE
